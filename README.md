# üîç check-quay-image

This action checks if a Quay image (tagged with the commit SHA) exists after a PR is merged.

It's useful when:

* Image builds (e.g. by Konflux) are not triggered automatically.
* You want to see if the image is missing or delayed.
* Your CI/CD depends on the image being ready.
It helps you catch problems early, before they break later steps.

## Features

- Works with public or private Quay.io repositories
- Polling logic with initial delay and retry intervals
- Fails the workflow if the image is not found
